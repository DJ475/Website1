                    University is an opportunity taken by young adults to start on their path to becoming a worker in a field. 
                    When completed a career is gained, making college students and scholars into experts and professionals in a field of study.
                    The habits of a good expert all depend on how and if they are able to spread their knowledge successfully, thus allowing those who learn from them to agree or disagree. 
                    Bad habits gained as an expert can stifle their knowledge and stop their credibility, however, the more knowledge you obtain before becoming one is crucial to an up incoming professional or expert.

                *When humans are wrong they do not admit to faults and then are unversed in the right answer

                *To overcome human nature is impossible so instead one should embrace it to then use it to give valid information

            <!-- The ability to acknowledge flaws can be beneficial to growth. Given the situation, a future expert learns that experts sometimes fail and lack certain characteristics. 
                Becoming an expert, you will have one flaw or instance of being wrong which will allow you two options either to see your flaws and improve or deny them and stay misinformed and create an obstacle for yourself.
                “Even faced with their results, many experts never admitted systematic flaws in their judgment. (Epstein 13).”  In this text Epstein is saying how even when stubborn experts are proven wrong, they still deny their faults and remain unversed in correct information. 
                A good example of professionals not changing their stance and not learning is proven in the quote. While the professionals do not admit being wrong, they never learn stifling their learning and creating a hindrance in their overall expert title.   -->

            <!-- One important requirement for a scholar to become an expert is being able to be open-minded. 
                The ability to be open-minded allows a person to be able to gain understanding from both sides, as well as find better explanations as to why one side is a better option to others. 
                In universities today you are given evidence of a text and get the choice to agree or disagree, but most professionals refuse to accept or even acknowledge what the other side represents, thus causing a loss of potential reliable theories or opinions. Mcraney states that, “For every Michael Moore documentary passed around as the truth there is an anti-Michael Moore counter documentary with its proponents trying to convince you their version of the truth is the better choice (McRaney 10).” 
                Every expert is going to try and convince you of what they believe is the truth, showing that both sides will have this aspect. In this situation, the experts are in a place where both sides are not open-minded, and this causes them to only research and sell the reader a version of what they believe. When this action occurs neither side is able to gain the others' knowledge and become a more reliable expert thus interrupting full potential information gathering.  -->

                    Finally, with these good behaviors a scholar is transformed into a knowledgeable person who is capable of listening to others who might have opposing views. 
                    They are now able to accept and know their flaws as human beings, thus continuously improving and not stifling their knowledge and rendering them experts of their own.
