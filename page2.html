        The ability to acknowledge flaws can be beneficial to growth. Given the situation, a future expert learns that experts sometimes fail and lack certain characteristics. 
        Becoming an expert, you will have one flaw or instance of being wrong which will allow you two options either to see your flaws and improve or deny them and stay misinformed and create an obstacle for yourself.
        “Even faced with their results, many experts never admitted systematic flaws in their judgment. (Epstein 13).”  In this text Epstein is saying how even when stubborn experts are proven wrong, they still deny their faults and remain unversed in correct information. 
        A good example of professionals not changing their stance and not learning is proven in the quote. While the professionals do not admit being wrong, they never learn stifling their learning and creating a hindrance in their overall expert title.

        Finally, with these good behaviors a scholar is transformed into a knowledgeable person who is capable of listening to others who might have opposing views. 
        They are now able to accept and know their flaws as human beings, thus continuously improving and not stifling their knowledge and rendering them experts of their own.
