    <p> 
        One important requirement for a scholar to become an expert is being able to be open-minded. 
        The ability to be open-minded allows a person to be able to gain understanding from both sides, as well as find better explanations as to why one side is a better option to others. 
        In universities today you are given evidence of a text and get the choice to agree or disagree, but most professionals refuse to accept or even acknowledge what the other side represents, thus causing a loss of potential reliable theories or opinions. Mcraney states that, “For every Michael Moore documentary passed around as the truth there is an anti-Michael Moore counter documentary with its proponents trying to convince you their version of the truth is the better choice (McRaney 10).” 
        Every expert is going to try and convince you of what they believe is the truth, showing that both sides will have this aspect. In this situation, the experts are in a place where both sides are not open-minded, and this causes them to only research and sell the reader a version of what they believe. When this action occurs neither side is able to gain the others' knowledge and become a more reliable expert thus interrupting full potential information gathering.
