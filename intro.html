        University is an opportunity taken by young adults to start on their path to becoming a worker in a field. 
        When completed a career is gained, making college students and scholars into experts and professionals in a field of study.
        The habits of a good expert all depend on how and if they are able to spread their knowledge successfully, thus allowing those who learn from them to agree or disagree. 
        Bad habits gained as an expert can stifle their knowledge and stop their credibility, however, the more knowledge you obtain before becoming one is crucial to an up incoming professional or expert.
